📌 About the Project

“Because even a coffee website deserves to wear couture."

Café Couture is more than just a website — it’s an immersive digital experience that reflects my passion for thoughtful design and purposeful coding. This was built as part of my personal front-end development learning journey, where I focused on layout mastery, responsive design, and elegant user experience.

The aesthetic inspiration comes from the elegance of French café culture — every section flows with intention, balance, and charm.
